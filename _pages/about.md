### Course Description

This course explores the principles and practice of mobile computing
and its close relative, pervasive computing (aka "Internet of Things
(IoT)").  Many traditional areas of computer science and computer
engineering are impacted by the constraints and demands of mobile and
pervasive computing. The course will offer significant hands-on
experience: in small teams, students will work under the guidance of a
mentor on a project.  Students will also, in small teams, present a
summary and overview of the commercial landscape for one of the topics
covered in class.  There will be a brief quiz at the start of each
class, based on the readings for that class.

### Necessary Background Knowledge

Students with solid backgrounds in operating systems, distributed
systems, and computer architecture will find that this course builds
naturally on their knowledge base.  Without these prerequisites, the
course may still be accessible to a student who is willing to put in
additional effort.  If in doubt, check with one of the instructors
before registering.

### Course Goals/Objectives

The primary goal of this course is to help students learn the core
principles and design challenges of two closely-related classes of
computing systems: (a) those in which wireless-enabled mobility is a
first-class design consideration, and (b) those that are rich in
sensing, computing and communication, yet gracefully integrated with
human users.  Although wireless networking plays an important role in
this course, it is not the sole or primary focus.

### Learning Outcomes

This course aims to impart conceptual knowledge, hands-on experience
and industry context.  A set of course readings gives students
conceptual knowledge on key topics in mobile and pervasive computing.
A substantial implementation project (roughly half the course credit)
gives hands-on experience.  Commercial scans that are researched and
presented by the students helps them to learn about the relevant state
of the art in industry, and how commercial practice diverges from
academic research.
